# The compression ratio achieved for the last question is approximately 0.7526; Achieving such ratio can be due to the following reasons:

# 1. Random strings have high entropy. High entropy means that the data is less predictable and, therefore, harder to compress effectively. There might not be obvious patterns in the data to achieve compression, making it a challenging candidate for high compression ratios.

# 2. The string is generated from a character set that includes both letters (uppercase and lowercase) and digits, totaling 62 different characters. This diversity further increases the string's entropy. With more unique characters, the likelihood of repeated patterns that can be efficiently compressed diminishes.

# 3. Zlib, which implements the DEFLATE compression algorithm, is generally more effective on data with noticeable patterns and redundancy. Since the input string is highly randomized, zlib's ability to find redundancy to achieve high compression is limited.
