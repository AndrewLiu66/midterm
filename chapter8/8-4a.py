# Given that Shakespeare's works contain about 884,421 words. We can assume an average English word length of 5 characters and 8 bits per character, and we can calculate the total number of Shakespeare's Works Information Content by using this formula: shakespeare_bits = shakespeare_words * average_word_length * bits_per_character, and finally get an estimation of Shakespeare's information content of 3.54 x 10^7 bits to represent all his works.

# Next,assume I have 10^11 neurons, and each making 1000 synaptic connections and that the (information) capacity result for one neuron (two bits per connection) applies, I can calculated the total brain capacity with this formula: brain_capacity_bits = neurons * synapses_per_neuron * bits_per_synapse, and plug in all the numbers, I can get a total capacity of 2 x 10^14 bits. By comparison, we can learn that the information content of Shakespeare's works are smaller than the brain's capacity. Thus, we can conclude that our brain is not full.
