# for the first neural network

# (a)

# For neural network a,
# Maximum MEC: 12+min（12，3）+min（4，3)=18 bits


# For neural network b,
# Maximum MEC: 3+min(4,4)+min(4,4)=11 bits

# (c)

# In case of binary classification, for network a, the maximum amount of rows network (a) can memorize is 18 rows, and the maximum amount of rows network (b) can memorize is 11 rows


# (d)

# for 4 classes classification for neural network A, the maximum amount of rows (a) can memorize is 9 rows, and the maximum amount of rows network (b) can memorize is 5 rows
